# TW2-Data-Clearning
Handing missing data and invalid data
Handling missing data is important as many machine learning algorithms do not support data with missing values. Our main objectives:

How to marking invalid or corrupt values as missing in a dataset.

How to remove rows with missing data from a dataset.

How to impute missing values with mean values in a dataset.

Two examples below will show the data cleaning process.
Learn from the examples by going through each cell.

Apply the learn tools to conduct preprocessing a new dataset.
